            <img class = "thumbnail" src="images/oreo_sitting.JPG" alt = "black pug terrier" width="400">
            <p>Oreo is a 20 pound pug terrier who is 6 years old. He loves following people around and always wants attention from anyone. He will play with any dog toys, especially the ones that you take from him. He likes going out on walks anytime of the day except when it is thunder storming, he will be running around the house trying to find a place to hide.</p>
            <p>After every walk, Oreo will always get the zoomies, or he will want to play fetch. He has a set schedule everyday where he likes to eat early morning around 9am and at night at 7pm. Oreo is a very high maintenance dog who needs a lot of attention but will give you all the love and kisses.</p>

        <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpeg" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei" width="400">
            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle.  He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him.  He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can 
                pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy.  He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride."  There is also a lot of rolling.  Lots and lots of rolling. </p>

        <h2>Jingle</h2>
            <img src="images/jingle.jpeg" alt="Picture of Jingle" width="500">

            <p>Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His
                paws are
                white and they look like mittens.
                Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get
                injured.
                Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes
                crazy
                and meows to go out.</p>

            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside;
                a bee
                stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for
                four
                days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>

        <h2>Rosie</h2>
            <img src="images/rosie.jpg" alt="Brown and White Bichon/Shitzhu mix" width="400">
            <p>Rosie is a small but super energetic dog. Whenever someone comes to the house she is very quick to run up and greet them. She loves to play fetch and will not leave you alone with her toys as she begs you to play with her.</p>
            <p>Rosie is also a wonderful lap dog. If you sit on the couch she is quick to find a spot next to you. If you wear a blanket over your legs, you'll find her laying on your legs. She loves to cuddle and loves to be pet so she will always be right up on you.</p>

        <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>
            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpeg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="200">
            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. </p>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</p>

        <h2>Terry</h2>
            <img src="images/terry_sitting.jpeg" alt="Black dachshund wearing leash and sitting." width="400">

            <p>Terry is a playful and spirited dachshund that loves to play fetch with his bone or tennis ball. He loves wandering in forests and finding large sticks to take home. His favorite foods are kibble and peanut butter. Terry will run around frantically when it’s time to eat at home.</p>
            <p>My family found Terry at a shelter and decided to adopt it. He was 4 months old and is now 8 years old. Terry knows how to swim, but we don’t tend to go often. Terry got poison ivy once; however, he quickly recovered and has been doing great since.
            </p>

        <h2>Finn</h2>
            <img src="images/Finn_Halloween.jpeg" width = "400" alt="3.	Finn wears a bat costume for halloween ">

            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I’m just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic. </p> 
            <p>Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it’s because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn’t like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.   </p>
